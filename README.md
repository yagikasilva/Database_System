# 📚 **Database System GUI with CustomTkinter**

This project is a simple **Database Management System** built using **Python**, **CustomTkinter**, **Tkinter**, and **Openpyxl** for managing basic **student** and **personal details**.

### **Key Styling Enhancements:**

1. **Headers and Sections**: Bold headers for clear separation of sections (`#`, `##`).
2. **Code Blocks**: Display code in a more readable format using triple backticks (```) for commands and files.
3. **Tables**: The screenshots section uses a table format to compare the tabs.
4. **Links**: Added links to relevant libraries (like CustomTkinter and openpyxl).
5. **Bullet Points**: Organized features and installation steps into clean bullet points.
